libjio - A library for Journaled I/O
Alberto Bertogli (albertito@blitiri.com.ar)
-------------------------------------------

As the name says, this is a simple userspace library to do journaled,
transaction-oriented I/O.

It provides a very simple transaction API to commit and rollback transactions,
and on top of that a unix-alike set of functions to perform most regular
operations (ie. open, read, write).

On the disk, the file you work on is exactly like a regular one, but a
special directory is created to store in-flight transactions.

This allows both simple file manipulation, recovery and debugging because
everything is isolated.

There are more detailed documents: a programming guide, a brief introduction
to the design and inner workings, and the manpage; all in the doc/ directory.


To see how to install it, please read the INSTALL file.

It is in the public domain, see the LICENSE file for more details.

Comments and patches are always welcome; please send them to my email address,
albertito@blitiri.com.ar.

Thanks,
		Alberto
