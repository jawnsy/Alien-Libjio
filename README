NAME
    Alien::Libjio - Installing and finding libjio (Journalled I/O library)

VERSION
    Version 1.0 ($Id: ISAAC.pm 7057 2009-05-12 22:51:01Z FREQUENCY@cpan.org
    $)

DESCRIPTION
    To ensure reliability, some file systems and databases provide support
    for something known as journalling. The idea is to ensure data
    consistency by creating a log of actions to be taken (called a Write
    Ahead Log) before committing them to disk. That way, if a transaction
    were to fail due to a system crash or other unexpected event, the write
    ahead log could be used to finish writing the data.

    While this functionality is often available with networked databases, it
    can be a rather memory- and processor-intensive solution, even where
    reliable writes are important. In other cases, the filesystem does not
    provide native journalling support, so other tricks may be used to
    ensure data integrity, such as writing to a separate temporary file and
    then overwriting the file instead of modifying it in-place.
    Unfortunately, this method cannot handle threaded operations
    appropriately.

    Thankfully, Alberto Bertogli published a userspace C library called
    libjio that can provide these features in a small (less than 1500 lines
    of code) library with no external dependencies.

    This package is designed to install it, and provide a way to get the
    flags necessary to compile programs using it. It is particularly useful
    for Perl XS programs that use it, such as IO::Journal.

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    By default, this library is installed wherever the main system libraries
    are usually installed. As a result, "Alien::Libjio" will only work if
    installed with root permissions.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.

CAVEATS
  KNOWN BUGS
    There are no known bugs as of this release.

  LIMITATIONS
    *   This module can only search known/common paths for libjio
        installations. It does try to use pkg-config and ExtUtils::Liblist
        to find a libjio installation on your system, but it cannot predict
        where files might have been installed. As a result, this package
        might install a duplicate copy of libjio.
